#   All lines that begin with a "#" are ignored.

#   The input image must be square.

#   The first line must specify the `pixel-area`
# the pixel-area is:
#   (the longitude at the start - the longitude at the end / the pixel count).
# Or equally (since the input image is a square image):
#   (the latitude at the start - the latitude at the end / the pixel count).

#   The second line must specify the `map-coordinate`;
# the area coordinate is the coordinate of the first pixel
# starting from the top right corner.

#   Colors inputted must be in a r, g, b format
# the red, green, and blue values must be specified from 0.0 - 1.0

#   Every new rule must be inputted in a seperate line.
# A rule is set in this format:
#   (rule's name) = (color)

#   All spaces and empty lines are ignored.
